## Rate limits and errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 429 error and can't make requests?">
If the rate limit for an endpoint is exceeded, you will receive a 429 error. To resolve this:

- Wait for the rate limit window to reset
- Check the specific rate limit value in the endpoint description
- Consider implementing rate limiting in your code

For more details, see the [API v4 overview](/public/http-v4).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I get a CORS error when requesting the whitebit.com/api/v4/public/ticker method?">
CORS requests to this endpoint are forbidden for security reasons. Make the request from your backend instead of client-side. For endpoint details, see the [Market activity endpoint](/public/http-v4/market-activity).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting nonce errors?">
Nonce errors occur when timestamps or request ordering are invalid. To resolve:

1. Debug your code implementation
2. Recreate your API keys
3. Ensure your system time is properly synchronized

For details on nonce requirements, see the [Authentication guide](/private/http-auth).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why am I getting a 403 error when making requests to the Smartplan endpoints?">
These endpoints are restricted to B2B partner services only. To gain access:

- Contact [support@whitebit.com](mailto:support@whitebit.com)
- Request permissions for Smartplan endpoints
- Provide your use case details

For endpoint details, see the [Crypto Lending documentation](/private/http-main-v4/get-plans).

## WebSocket

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I get information on pairs for multiple time periods in the WebSocket Kline method?">
Yes, you can use multiple WebSocket connections or the HTTP method. There are two solutions:

1. Open multiple WebSocket connections
2. Use the equivalent HTTP method instead

For more details, see the [Kline documentation](/public/websocket/kline).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I see trade history for a pair in the last 24 hours?">
The system only shows the last 100 deals by default. To see more:

- Subscribe to the WebSocket feed
- Accumulate and store the data on your side
- Process the data as needed for your use case

For more details, see the [Trades channel documentation](/public/websocket/trades).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Transfers and withdrawals

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why doesn't my transfer between balances go through when I transfer assets via API?">
Transfers may take up to 2 seconds to complete. When making transfers and withdrawals:

- Wait for transfers to complete (approximately 2 seconds)
- Don't initiate withdrawals before transfer completion
- Implement proper error handling for transfer states

For endpoint details, see the [Transfer between balances](/private/http-main-v4/transfer-between-balances) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I get an insufficient funds error when I have assets on my balance?">
This occurs when the withdrawal amount plus the fee exceeds your available balance. Remember to:

- Account for withdrawal fees in your calculations
- Check the [fees documentation](/private/http-main-v4/get-fees)
- Ensure sufficient balance for both amount and fees
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhooks

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Do I need HTTPS for Webhook API communication, and which port is used?">
Yes, HTTPS is required:

- Communication occurs over port 443
- SSL/TLS encryption is mandatory
- HTTP connections are not supported

For more details, see the [Webhook documentation](/platform/webhook).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API and assets

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How can I check if deposits and withdrawals are available for a specific currency?">
You can check currency status through the assets endpoint:

- URL: [https://whitebit.com/api/v4/public/assets](https://whitebit.com/api/v4/public/assets)
- This endpoint provides real-time status of all currencies
- Check the currency-specific enabled/disabled flags

For endpoint details and response schema, see the [Asset status list](/public/http-v4/asset-status-list) documentation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and API keys

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How do I ensure my API keys are secure?">
Store your API keys securely using environment variables, restrict IP access, and use the minimum required permissions. Never share your keys.

For details, see the [Authentication guide](/private/http-auth).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I do if I suspect my API key is compromised?">
Immediately delete the compromised key, review your account activity for unauthorized actions, and create new API keys. Contact support if you detect unauthorized activity.

For details, see the [Authentication guide](/private/http-auth).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How can I optimize my API usage for high-frequency trading?">
Use WebSocket for real-time data, batch requests when possible, implement proper rate limiting, and cache frequently accessed data.

For details, see the [WebSocket API](/public/websocket).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I handle API disconnections?">
Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. Maintain local order state and set up monitoring and alerts for connection issues.
