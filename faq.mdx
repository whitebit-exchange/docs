## Rate limits and errors

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Rate limit 429 errors">
Rate limit 429 errors occur when an endpoint exceeds the rate limit. To resolve:

- Wait for the rate limit window to reset
- Check the specific rate limit value in the endpoint documentation
- Implement rate limiting in code

For more details, see the [API v4 overview](/api-reference/market-data/overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="CORS errors on ticker endpoint">
CORS requests to the ticker endpoint are forbidden for security reasons. Make the request from a backend server instead of client-side code. For endpoint details, see the [Market activity endpoint](/api-reference/market-data/market-activity).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Nonce error troubleshooting">
Nonce errors occur when timestamps or request ordering are invalid. To resolve:

1. Debug the code implementation
2. Recreate API keys
3. Ensure system time is properly synchronized

For details on nonce requirements, see the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Smartplan endpoint 403 access errors">
Smartplan endpoints are restricted to B2B partner services only. To gain access:

- Contact [support@whitebit.com](mailto:support@whitebit.com)
- Request permissions for Smartplan endpoints
- Provide use case details

For endpoint details, see the [Crypto Lending documentation](/api-reference/account-wallet/get-plans).

## WebSocket

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Multiple time periods in WebSocket Kline">
Multiple time periods for pairs are available through multiple WebSocket connections or the HTTP method. Two solutions:

1. Open multiple WebSocket connections
2. Use the equivalent HTTP method instead

For more details, see the [Kline documentation](/websocket/market-streams/kline).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Trade history limitations (24-hour window)">
The system shows only the last 100 deals by default. To access more:

- Subscribe to the WebSocket feed
- Accumulate and store the data
- Process the data as needed

For more details, see the [Trades channel documentation](/websocket/market-streams/trades).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Transfers and withdrawals

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Transfer delays between balances">
Transfers may take up to 2 seconds to complete. When making transfers and withdrawals:

- Wait for transfers to complete (approximately 2 seconds)
- Avoid initiating withdrawals before transfer completion
- Implement proper error handling for transfer states

For endpoint details, see the [Transfer between balances](/api-reference/account-wallet/transfer-between-balances) documentation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Insufficient funds errors despite available balance">
Insufficient funds errors occur when the withdrawal amount plus the fee exceeds available balance. Important considerations:

- Account for withdrawal fees in calculations
- Check the [fees documentation](/api-reference/account-wallet/get-fees)
- Ensure sufficient balance for both amount and fees
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Webhooks

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Webhook HTTPS requirements and port">
HTTPS is required for Webhook API communication:

- Communication occurs over port 443
- SSL/TLS encryption is mandatory
- HTTP connections are not supported

For more details, see the [Webhook documentation](/platform/webhook).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API and assets

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Currency deposit and withdrawal availability">
Check currency status through the assets endpoint:

- URL: [https://whitebit.com/api/v4/public/assets](https://whitebit.com/api/v4/public/assets)
- The endpoint provides real-time status of all currencies
- Check the currency-specific enabled/disabled flags

For endpoint details and response schema, see the [Asset status list](/api-reference/market-data/asset-status-list) documentation.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security and API keys

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="API key security best practices">
Store API keys securely using environment variables, restrict IP access, and use minimum required permissions. Never commit keys to version control.

For details, see the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Compromised API key response">
Immediately delete the compromised key, review account activity for unauthorized actions, and create new API keys. Contact support if unauthorized activity is detected.

For details, see the [Authentication guide](/api-reference/authentication).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## API usage

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="High-frequency trading API optimization">
Use WebSocket for real-time data, batch requests when possible, implement proper rate limiting, and cache frequently accessed data.

For details, see the [WebSocket API](/websocket/market-streams/overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="API disconnection handling">
Implement automatic reconnection with exponential backoff. Maintain local order state and set up monitoring and alerts for connection issues.

For details, see the [WebSocket API](/websocket/market-streams/overview).
