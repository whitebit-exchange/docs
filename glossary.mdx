## R

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Retail Price Improvement (RPI)">

Retail Price Improvement (RPI) defines a [limit order](#limit-order) mode improving execution for retail users and keeping the order out of public market data feeds.

**Visibility**

Public `depth` and `bookTicker` feeds exclude RPI orders in both WebSocket and REST responses. Private active order endpoints and private WebSocket streams return RPI orders. The exchange UI [order book](#order-book) (web and mobile) displays RPI orders.

**IOC compatibility**

RPI orders use post-only behavior by design. An RPI order does not support the IOC flag. The API returns error code `37` when a request sets both `rpi=true` and `ioc=true`.

**Fees**

RPI executions apply a specific [fee](#fee) or rebate model defined for the account. When a user trades through a [sub-account](#sub-account), the system applies the effective sub-account fee configuration. Use the `Query Market Fee` or `Query All Market Fees` endpoints to retrieve effective fees.

<Accordion title="Sub-account">

Use [`Query Market Fee`](/private/http-trade-v4/query-market-fee) and [`Query All Market Fees`](/private/http-trade-v4/query-all-market-fees) to retrieve effective fees when an API key belongs to a sub-account.

[RPI](#retail-price-improvement-rpi) trading uses account-specific fees or rebates. When a user places RPI orders through a sub-account, the system applies the effective sub-account fees. Use [`Query Market Fee`](/private/http-trade-v4/query-market-fee) and [`Query All Market Fees`](/private/http-trade-v4/query-all-market-fees) to verify fees for RPI executions.
