Access AI-optimized content and AI tool integrations via the **Copy page** dropdown on any WhiteBIT documentation page.

The **Copy page** dropdown is available at the top of every documentation page. The menu provides options to copy page content for AI consumption, open pages directly in AI chat tools, and connect development environments to the full documentation via MCP.

## Access the contextual menu

Select the **Copy page** dropdown next to the document title on any page. The menu opens with all available options grouped by function.

## Page content options

### Copy page

Copies the current page content as standard Markdown. Use when sharing documentation content or pasting into a text editor.

### Copy page as Markdown for LLMs

Copies the current page content in an AI-optimized Markdown format with additional context for language models. Use when feeding page content to an AI tool for analysis or asking questions about a specific page.

### View as Markdown

Opens a plain-text Markdown view of the current page. Use when previewing the raw content of a documentation page.

## Open in AI tool

Each option opens the current page content in the selected AI chat tool with the page pre-loaded as context.

| Option | AI tool | Best for |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Open in ChatGPT | ChatGPT (OpenAI) | Quick questions about the current page |
| Open in Claude | Claude (Anthropic) | Detailed analysis or code generation from the current page |
| Open in Perplexity | Perplexity | Research-oriented questions about the current page |
| Open in Grok | Grok (xAI) | Questions and analysis with the current page as context |

## MCP and IDE quick connect

The contextual menu includes one-click options to connect a development environment to the WhiteBIT documentation MCP server at `https://docs.whitebit.com/mcp`.

| Option | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Copy MCP Server URL | Copies `https://docs.whitebit.com/mcp` to the clipboard for manual configuration |
| Connect to Cursor | Opens Cursor with the WhiteBIT MCP server pre-configured |
| Connect to VS Code | Opens VS Code with the WhiteBIT MCP server pre-configured |

For manual configuration steps in Cursor, VS Code, and Claude Desktop, see the [IDE and AI client setup](/guides/ai-ide-setup) guide.

## Full documentation context

The following URLs provide the complete WhiteBIT documentation in AI-optimized formats for use with any AI tool that accepts pasted or linked content.

| Resource | URL | Use when |
|----------|-----|----------|
| Documentation index | `https://docs.whitebit.com/llms.txt` | Discovering all available pages before exploring further |
| Full documentation | `https://docs.whitebit.com/llms-full.txt` | Providing comprehensive documentation context across the entire API reference |

## Best practices

**Provide context**

Include relevant details when asking AI questions:
- Mention the specific API endpoint or feature in scope.
- Include code snippets when asking about implementation.
- For questions that span multiple pages, use `llms-full.txt` for comprehensive context.

**Combine approaches**

- Use the contextual menu for quick, page-specific questions and one-off tasks.
- Use the [IDE and AI client setup](/guides/ai-ide-setup) for ongoing development with full documentation search.
- Both approaches work together for optimal AI assistance.
