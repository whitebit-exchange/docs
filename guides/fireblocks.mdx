## Overview

<Card>
The Fireblocks Network is a secure transfer system enabling immediate discovery, connection, and transfer of digital assets among exchanges, fiat providers, liquidity partners, and counterparties.

To connect a WhiteBIT account to Fireblocks, generate a unique API key and an API secret. These are the credentials required to use an API Hook.

<Warning>
The standard WhiteBIT API key is unsuitable for Fireblocks integration. Generate a specific Fireblocks API key following the instructions below.
