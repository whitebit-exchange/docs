## Overview

<Card>
The Fireblocks Network is a secure transfer system enabling immediate discovery, connection, and transfer of digital assets among exchanges, fiat providers, liquidity partners, and counterparties.

To successfully connect your WhiteBIT account to Fireblocks, you must generate a unique API key and an API secret. These are the credentials required to use an API Hook.
</Card>

<Warning>
The standard WhiteBIT API key is unsuitable for Fireblocks integration. You must generate a specific Fireblocks API key following the instructions below.
</Warning>
