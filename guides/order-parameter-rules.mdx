## Overview

This guide describes parameter combinations that the API does not support and explains how to resolve related errors.

## Retail Price Improvement (RPI) and IOC

RPI orders use post-only behavior by design. An RPI order does not support the IOC flag.

### Issue

A request sets both `rpi=true` and `ioc=true`.

### Result

The API rejects the request and returns error code `37`.

### Fix

Remove `ioc` when using `rpi`, or disable `rpi` when IOC behavior is required.
