## Withdrawal Scenarios Guide

The endpoint supports **8 different withdrawal scenarios**. Each scenario requires different fields depending on the currency type, destination, and regulatory requirements. Use the example selector above to switch between scenarios.

### 🔹 Cryptocurrency Withdrawals

#### **Scenario 1: Simple Crypto Withdrawal**
For standard cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, LTC, etc.
- **Required fields**: `ticker`, `amount`, `address`, `uniqueId`
- **Use when**: Withdrawing to a standard blockchain address

#### **Scenario 2: Multi-Network Crypto (USDT, USDC)**
For cryptocurrencies existing on multiple blockchains.
- **Required fields**: Same as above + `network`
- **Networks**: ERC20 (Ethereum), TRC20 (Tron), BEP20 (BSC), OMNI, etc.
- **Use when**: Withdrawing tokens existing on multiple chains

<Warning>
**Critical**: Ensure the `network` matches the destination address type. Sending ERC20 USDT to a TRC20 address will result in **permanent loss of funds**. Verify the network on [Asset Status endpoint](/api-reference/market-data/asset-status-list).
</Warning>

#### **Scenario 3: Travel Rule Compliance (EEA Users)**
Required for crypto withdrawals when the account is registered in the European Economic Area (EEA).
- **Required fields**: Standard crypto fields + `travelRule` object
- **Travel rule types**: 
  - `individual` - Personal withdrawals (requires first name / last name)
  - `entity` - Business withdrawals (requires company name / address)
- **Use when**: The account is registered in EEA countries

### 🔹 Fiat Withdrawals (KYC Required)

<Note>
All fiat withdrawals require KYC verification. Ensure the account is verified before attempting fiat withdrawals.
</Note>

#### **Scenario 4: Basic Fiat Withdrawal**
Standard fiat withdrawal via VISAMASTER provider.
- **Required fields**: `ticker`, `amount`, `provider`, `uniqueId`
- **Currencies**: UAH, USD, EUR, etc.
- **Use when**: Standard fiat withdrawal within normal limits

#### **Scenario 5: Fiat with Partial Enable**
For withdrawals exceeding standard limits with "partially successful" status support.
- **Required fields**: Same as basic + `partialEnable: true` + `address` (encrypted card token)
- **Use when**: Withdrawing larger amounts eligible for partial processing
- **Important**: The application must handle "Partially successful" withdrawal status

#### **Scenario 6: IBAN Transfers (UAH_IBAN)**
Bank transfer withdrawals to IBAN accounts.
- **Required fields**: Standard fields + `beneficiary` object with:
  - `firstName`, `lastName` (max 40 symbols, latin letters)
  - `tin` (Tax Identification Number, 10 digits)
- **Use when**: Withdrawing UAH to Ukrainian bank accounts via IBAN

#### **Scenario 7: International Fiat (USD/EUR VISAMASTER)**
Withdrawals with extended beneficiary information.
- **Required fields**: Standard fields + `beneficiary` object with:
  - `firstName`, `lastName`, `phone`, `email`, `birthDate` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Use when**: Withdrawing USD or EUR via VISAMASTER_PAYCORE provider
- **Currencies**: USD_VISAMASTER, EUR_VISAMASTER

## Amount and Fee Calculation

<Tip>
The `amount` field in the request **includes** the withdrawal fee. The recipient receives `amount - fee`.
</Tip>

### How it works:

**Example request** (`/withdraw`):
- Balance: 100 USDT
- Withdrawal fee: 2 USDT
- Request `amount: "100"`
- **Result**: 100 USDT deducted from balance, recipient receives **98 USDT**

**Alternative approach** (use `/withdraw-pay` instead):
- Balance: 100 USDT
- Withdrawal fee: 2 USDT  
- Request `amount: "98"`
- **Result**: 102 USDT deducted from balance, recipient receives **98 USDT**

<Note>
To specify the exact amount the recipient should receive (with fee added on top), use the [withdraw-pay endpoint](/api-reference/account-wallet/create-withdraw-request-with-specific-amount) instead.
</Note>

Check current fees via [Get Fees endpoint](/api-reference/account-wallet/get-fees) before creating withdrawals.

## Common Pitfalls & Best Practices

### ⚠️ Unique ID Management

<Warning>
**Critical**: Generate a **NEW** `uniqueId` for each withdrawal request. 

Reusing the same `uniqueId` will result in:
```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "uniqueId": ["The unique id has already been taken."]
  }
}
```
</Warning>

**Best practice**: Use a timestamp-based or UUID generator:
- ✅ Good: `"24529041"`, `"withdrawal_1640995200_abc123"`
- ❌ Bad: Reusing `"12345"` for multiple withdrawals

### ⚠️ Address Validation

Different currencies have different address formats:
- **Bitcoin**: Starts with `1`, `3`, or `bc1` (SegWit)
- **Ethereum/ERC20**: Starts with `0x`, 42 characters
- **Tron/TRC20**: Starts with `T`, 34 characters
- **Fiat**: Card token or IBAN format

The platform validates addresses, but double-check addresses before sending.

### ⚠️ Memo/Destination Tag

Some currencies require a memo (destination tag):
- **XLM (Stellar)**: Requires memo
- **XRP (Ripple)**: Requires destination tag
- **EOS**: Requires memo

<Warning>
Missing a required memo will result in **permanent loss of funds** or significant delays in recovery. Check currency requirements on [Asset Status endpoint](/api-reference/market-data/asset-status-list).
</Warning>

### ⚠️ Provider Selection (Fiat)

Fiat withdrawals require the correct provider:
- Check available providers via [Asset Status endpoint](/api-reference/market-data/asset-status-list)
- Common providers: `VISAMASTER`, `VISAMASTER_PAYCORE`, `UAH_IBAN`
- Provider availability depends on currency and region

---

## Workflow: Complete Withdrawal Process

### Step 1: Pre-Withdrawal Checks

```
1. Check balance: GET /api/v4/main-account/balance
2. Get withdrawal fees: POST /api/v4/main-account/fee  
3. Verify currency is withdrawable: GET /api/v4/public/assets
   - Check "can_withdraw" status is "true"
   - Get available networks/providers
   - Check minimum/maximum amounts
```

### Step 2: Create Withdrawal

```
POST /api/v4/main-account/withdraw
```

**Success response**: `[]` (empty array)

Validation succeeded and the withdrawal process has started. The withdrawal is now queued for processing.

### Step 3: Monitor Status

```
POST /api/v4/main-account/history
```

Search by `uniqueId` to track the transaction.

**Withdrawal status codes**:
- **Successful**: 3, 7
- **Canceled**: 4, 9  
- **Pending**: Other codes (see [history endpoint](/api-reference/account-wallet/get-deposit-withdraw-history) for full list)

<Note>
Cryptocurrency withdrawals are typically processed within 15-60 minutes depending on network congestion. Fiat withdrawals may take 1-5 business days depending on the payment provider.
</Note>

## Network Selection Guide

For multi-network currencies (USDT, USDC, etc.), choosing the right network is critical:

| Network | Speed | Fee | Use When |
|---------|-------|-----|----------|
| **ERC20** (Ethereum) | Slow | High | Large amounts, highest security |
| **TRC20** (Tron) | Fast | Very Low | Small/medium amounts, fastest option |
| **BEP20** (BSC) | Fast | Low | Good balance of speed and cost |
| **OMNI** | Very Slow | High | Legacy, rarely used |

<Tip>
**Default network**: If the `network` parameter is omitted, the default network is used (typically ERC20 for USDT). Always specify the network explicitly to avoid confusion.
</Tip>

## Error Handling

### Common validation errors (400):

**Missing required fields**:
```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "address": ["The address field is required."],
    "amount": ["The amount field is required."],
    "ticker": ["The ticker field is required."],
    "uniqueId": ["The unique id field is required."]
  }
}
```

**Invalid ticker**:
```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "ticker": ["The selected ticker is invalid."]
  }
}
```

**KYC required**:
```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "amount": [
      "This currency has no active pairs or it may have been delisted.",
      "Current limit exceeded"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Inner validation errors (422):

**Error codes**:
- `1` - Currency is not withdrawable
- `2` - Specified address is invalid  
- `3` - Amount is too small
- `4` - Amount is too small for the payment system
- `5` - Not enough balance
- `6` - Amount is less than or equals fee
- `7` - Amount should be integer (zero precision currencies like NEO)
- `8` - Target withdraw amount without fee equals zero
- `9` - Address is unavailable (withdrawal to own address blocked)

**Example**:
```json
{
  "code": 5,
  "message": "Inner validation failed",
  "errors": {
    "amount": ["Not enough money, Ethereum balance = 1"]
  }
}
```

## Security Recommendations

<Warning>
**Always verify withdrawal requests**:
1. Double-check the destination address
2. Verify the network (for multi-network currencies)
3. Confirm the amount and fee calculation
4. Test with a small amount first for new addresses
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Withdrawal safety checklist**:
- ✅ Address is correct and copied without errors
- ✅ Network matches the destination (ERC20, TRC20, etc.)
- ✅ Memo/tag included if required
- ✅ Amount is within the available balance minus fees
- ✅ Unique ID is newly generated
- ✅ Provider is correct (for fiat)
</Tip>
