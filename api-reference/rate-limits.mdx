Reference for REST API rate limits, error formats, and error codes.

## REST API rate limits

| Scope | Limit |
|-------|-------|
| Public REST endpoints | 2000 requests / 10 sec |
| Private REST endpoints | Varies per endpoint (see individual endpoint pages) |

Private endpoints such as [Main Balance](/api-reference/account-wallet/main-balance) have a rate limit of 1000 requests / 10 sec. Check each endpoint page for the endpoint-specific limit.

When the rate limit is exceeded, the API returns HTTP status `429` (Too Many Requests). Use exponential backoff before retrying (see Best practices below).

## REST API error format

All v4 endpoints return errors as JSON. The format differs between public and private APIs.

### Public endpoints

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "ERROR MESSAGE",
  "params": []
}
```

### Private endpoints

```json
{
  "code": 0,
  "message": "MESSAGE",
  "errors": {
    "PARAM1": ["MESSAGE"],
    "PARAM2": ["MESSAGE"]
  }
}
```

## Authentication error reference

The following errors are returned by private REST endpoints when the request signature or credentials are invalid.

| Error message | Cause | Resolution |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| "Too many requests." | Nonce value is not greater than previous request | Use incrementing nonce values |
| "This action is unauthorized. Enable your key in API settings" | Using a disabled API key | Enable the key in API settings or check IP restrictions |
| "You don't have permission to use this endpoint." | Endpoint access is restricted | Update endpoint access in API key settings |
| "Invalid payload" | Payload does not match the decoded value | Ensure proper base64 encoding of the request body |
| "Unauthorized request." | Request signed incorrectly | Verify the signature creation process |
| "Nonce not provided." | Missing nonce in request body | Include nonce in all requests |
| "Your nonce is more than 5 seconds lesser than the current nonce" | Invalid timestamp when using nonceWindow | Use current Unix timestamp in milliseconds |
| "Invalid nonceWindow." | nonceWindow is not a boolean | Set nonceWindow to `true` or `false` |
| "Request not provided." | Missing request path in body | Include the request path in all requests |

## HTTP status codes

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad request — invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid authentication |
| `403` | Forbidden — insufficient permissions |
| `404` | Not found — endpoint does not exist |
| `429` | Too Many Requests — rate limit exceeded |
| `500` | Internal server error — retry with backoff |

## Best practices

### Exponential backoff

When rate limited, wait before retrying. Double the wait time after each failed attempt (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s).

### Batch requests

Combine multiple operations when the API supports batch endpoints. For example, use [Bulk Limit Order](/api-reference/spot-trading/bulk-limit-order) instead of multiple single order requests.

### Nonce management

For private endpoints, ensure each request uses a unique, incrementing nonce. Use Unix timestamp in milliseconds when `nonceWindow` is enabled. Avoid concurrent requests with the same nonce.
