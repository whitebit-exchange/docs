## How to use

1. Log in to whitebit.com.
2. Open the API keys tab.
3. Select the web-hook configuration tab for the API keys.
4. Paste the correct URI for the web server to process web-hook calls.
5. Press Generate a new key button and toggle the activation switcher to "Activated".

<Warning>
The secret key is shown only once. Save it in a secure key store.

## Requirements

### For web hook keys generation

Before using webhooks, verify ownership of the domain set as the webhook destination. Use one of three methods:

1. Add a TXT DNS record to the domain with the webhook public key.
2. Add the plain text file `whiteBIT-verification.txt` to the root domain folder and provide public web access. Place the public webhook key in the file.
3. Implement the `/whiteBIT-verification` endpoint to respond with 200 OK and return a JSON array containing the public webhook key. Example: `["<public-webhook-key>"]`

Passing one of these checks enables the webhook.

### For processing web-hook requests

All web hook requests are performing using POST method and with application/json content type. Consumer server should respond with 200 HTTP status code. If consumer was unable to handle web-hook, the request will be retry every 10 minutes but not more than 5 times.

#### Body data

All web-hook requests are performing with

```json
{
  "method": "string",
  "params": {
    "nonce": 0
  },
  "id": "uniqueID"
}
```

**method** - string. The name of method which was evaluated. Web hooks API supports such web-hook methods:

- **code.apply**. Performs when code owned by a customer was applied.

**id** - string. Uuid to identify every request.

**params** - the request payload. Contains data about the actions triggering the webhook call. The field also contains a [nonce](/glossary#nonce). **'nonce'** - a number always **greater** than the previous request’s nonce number

#### Request headers

Also, all request contains additional data in headers:

1. `'Content-type': 'application/json'`
2. `'X-TXC-APIKEY': api_key` - the WhiteBIT webhook API key
3. `'X-TXC-PAYLOAD': payload'` - where payload is base64-encoded body data
4. `'X-TXC-SIGNATURE': signature` - where signature is `hex(HMAC_SHA512(payload), key=api_secret))`

On the consumer side, process the security headers to verify the request originated from WhiteBIT.
