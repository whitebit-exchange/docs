## Introduction

WhiteBIT API provides comprehensive access to the trading platform through both `public` and `private` endpoints. Using any WhiteBIT API endpoint confirms agreement to the [Terms of Use](https://whitebit.com/terms/api).

## REST API

- **Authentication**: Required for all private endpoints — [Authentication Guide](/api-reference/authentication)

- **Helper Library**: [API Quick Start Helper](https://github.com/whitebit-exchange/api-quickstart) with examples in multiple languages
