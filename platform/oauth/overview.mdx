- **Streamlined Trading Experience**: Enables seamless integration with portfolio trackers, trading bots, and analysis tools
- **Developer-Friendly**: Standardized implementation familiar to developers across the ecosystem

## How WhiteBIT OAuth Works
<Steps>
<Step title="Authorization">
 Users approve access for a third-party application through WhiteBIT’s authorization page
</Step>
<Step title="Token Exchange">
The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token
</Step>
<Step title="API Access">
The application uses the access token to make API calls to WhiteBIT on the user’s behalf
</Step>
<Step title="Token Refresh">
When the access token expires, the application can use a refresh token to obtain a new one
</Step>
</Steps>
## Use Cases

#### Trading Bots & Algorithmic Trading
Enable automated trading strategies without storing WhiteBIT credentials in third-party systems. Trading bots can place, modify, and cancel orders while only having the specific permissions they need.

### Portfolio Trackers & Analytics
Allow portfolio management applications to read balance and trade history information without write access to trading functions, providing users with consolidated views of their assets across multiple platforms.

### Mobile Applications
Provide a seamless authentication experience in mobile apps without requiring users to enter and store their WhiteBIT credentials in the app.

### Enterprise Integrations
Enable business systems to securely connect to WhiteBIT for institutional trading, reporting, and compliance purposes with proper audit controls.
