## Subscription Behavior

<Warning>
For each WebSocket connection, you can subscribe to either specific markets or all markets. **Every new subscription replaces the existing one.**
</Warning>

### Subscribe to Specific Markets

To receive trade updates for specific markets, provide market names in the `params` array:

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "method": "trades_subscribe",
    "params": [
        "ETH_BTC",
        "BTC_USDT"
    ]
}
```

### Subscribe to All Markets

To receive trade updates for all available markets, send an empty `params` array:

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "method": "trades_subscribe",
    "params": []
}
```

## RPI Field

Trade updates may include an `rpi` field:

- `rpi: true` - The trade involved a Retail Price Improvement (RPI) order
- `rpi: false` or absent - Regular trade

<Info>
RPI orders provide better execution prices than the current best bid/ask for retail traders.
</Info>

<Note>
Public trade updates can include executions that originate from RPI orders.

Public market data feeds do not expose RPI orders as visible liquidity in `depth` or `bookTicker`. RPI orders remain visible only in private active orders and in the exchange UI order book (web and mobile).
</Note>
