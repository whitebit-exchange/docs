## Overview

The Book Ticker channel provides real-time best bid and best ask updates for a market.

The stream sends updates whenever the best bid or best ask price changes.

<Note>
	Public `bookTicker_update` events exclude Retail Price Improvement (RPI) orders.

	The stream includes only regular order book liquidity. Private active order endpoints and private WebSocket streams return RPI orders. The exchange UI order book (web and mobile) displays RPI orders.
</Note>

## Update Behavior

The server sends a `bookTicker_update` message whenever the best bid or best ask changes.

Each update contains:
- Current best bid price and amount.
- Current best ask price and amount.
