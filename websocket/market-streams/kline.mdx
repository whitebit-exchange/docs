## Overview

Candlestick data operations.

**Update Interval**: 0.5 seconds (for subscriptions)

## Interval Constraints

The requested interval must meet specific mathematical conditions to ensure proper candle alignment:

### Rules by Interval Size

<Accordion title="Less than 60 seconds">
- 60 must be divisible by the interval without remainder
- Valid examples: 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 10s, 12s, 15s, 20s, 30s
- Invalid examples: 7s, 11s, 13s, 17s
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="60 seconds to 1 hour (60-3599s)">
- Interval must be divisible by 60 without remainder
- 3600 must be divisible by the interval without remainder
- Valid examples: 1m (60s), 2m (120s), 3m (180s), 5m (300s), 15m (900s), 30m (1800s)
- Invalid examples: 7m (420s), 11m (660s)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="1 hour to 1 day (3600-86399s)">
- Interval must be divisible by 3600 without remainder
- 86400 must be divisible by the interval without remainder
- Valid examples: 1h (3600s), 2h (7200s), 4h (14400s), 6h (21600s), 12h (43200s)
- Invalid examples: 5h (18000s), 7h (25200s)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="1 day to 1 week (86400-604799s)">
- Interval must be divisible by 86400 without remainder
- Valid examples: 1d (86400s), 2d (172800s), 3d (259200s)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Special intervals">
- **1 week**: 604800 seconds (86400 × 7)
- **1 month**: 2592000 seconds (86400 × 30)
</Accordion>

<Note>
These constraints ensure candles align with natural time boundaries (minutes, hours, days) for consistent charting.
