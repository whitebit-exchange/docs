        The system processes refunds only for deposits with status `canceled`.

        Obtain `transactionId` from the `deposit.canceled` webhook (`uniqueId`) or from the deposit/withdraw history in the WhiteBIT interface after support confirms refund availability.

        The refund address must support the same network and asset as the original deposit. The refund address must not be a WhiteBIT address. The refund address can differ from the original deposit sender address.

      summary: Create withdraw request with specific withdraw amount (fee not included)
      description: |
        This endpoint has the similar logic as /main-account/withdraw, but with the only difference: amount that is specified will not include [fee](/glossary#fee) (it will be calculated to make target withdraw amount equal to the specified amount).

        **Example:**
        - When you create base withdraw and set amount = 100 USD, receiver will receive 100 USD - [fee](/glossary#fee) amount, and your balance will decrease by 100 USD.
        - When you use this endpoint and set amount = 100 USD, receiver will receive 100 USD, and your balance will decrease by 100 USD + [fee](/glossary#fee) amount.

        This endpoint retrieves all active [plans](/glossary#crypto-lending).
        
        <Note>
        These endpoints are available only for B2B partner services. You need to fill the institutional services form in order to get permissions to use these endpoints.
        </Note>

        **Note:** When target currency is different from source currency, interest amount in target currency will be calculated using `interestRatio` value.

        **Examples:**
        - When source currency = USDT, target currency = BTC and interest ratio = 40000, it means that you will receive interest in BTC that equals interest amount in USDT divided by interest ratio (in this case 0.000025 BTC per each 1 USDT of interest amount).
        - When source currency equals target currency, interest ratio equals 1.
